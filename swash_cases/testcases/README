The following test cases can be used to make a configuration test of SWASH on your computer:

a11stwav  -  a test with standing waves in a basin
a13stwav  -  more tests with standing waves in a basin
a14prwav  -  tests with progressive waves
a31wndcb  -  tests with wind setup in closed basin
a34wndco  -  tests with wind setup in semi-closed basin
a46jump   -  test with hydraulic jump and drop in open river
a61dambr  -  tests with dam break
a81tidal  -  tidal wave flow case
l12bbbar  -  test with wave propagation over submerged bar (Beji and Battjes experiment)
l31setup  -  test with wave breaking on barred beach (Boers 1C experiment)
l33turb   -  2DV turbulent channel flow (Nezu and Rodi, 1986)
l41berkh  -  wave deformation by an elliptic shoal on sloped bottom (Berkhoff et al. experiment)
t11coupl  -  test of coupling SWAN - SWASH
t52lock   -  lock exchange test

Below some tests that employ an unstructured triangular mesh

u11stwav  -  a test with standing waves in a basin (comparable to a11stwav)
u13stwav  -  more tests with standing waves in a basin (comparable to a13stwav)
u33turb   -  2DV turbulent channel flow (comparable to l33turb)

Instructions for use
--------------------

1) open dos prompt
2) go to the directory of one of the available test cases (use 'CD' command)
3) run the test case by just typing

   swashrun <name_test>

   with <name_test> the appropriate filename of the test case without extension '.sws'
4) use Matlab for postprocessing. In all cases, just type

   mkplot

5) have fun!
